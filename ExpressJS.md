### Express:
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. Some interesting feature of it are

- Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.
- Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTPMethod and URL.
- Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.

```sh
npm install express --save
```

### Some Utility Library:

- body-parser − This is a node.js middleware for handling JSON, Raw, Text and URL encoded form data.

- cookie-parser − Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.

- multer − This is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data.

```sh
$ npm install body-parser --save
$ npm install cookie-parser --save
$ npm install multer --save
```

### Simple Express Server:
`get` method of express object has a route and a callback function. The callback receives a Request and a Response Object as its param. `Response.send()` is what will be return when request for a route.

- `Request Object` − The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.

- `Response Object` − The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

```js
const express = require("express")
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("hello world")
})

const server = app.listen(8081, () => {
    // the outer variable `server` is already available inside the callback at this point
    var host = server.address().address
    var port = server.address().port

    console.log("Example app listening at http://%s:%s", host, port)
})
```

`curl http://localhost:8081/` running in shell will return `Hello World`
`curl -w "\nTotal time it took: %{time_total}\n" -s http://localhost:8081/`
