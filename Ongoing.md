=> Node gRPC
=> Compose | SwiftUI | React Native (Finish Remaining)

### Next (Side by Side with `iOS, Android and React Native` as Main):

=> Spring Boot Authentication (Credentials, OAuth, Email, JWT)
=> Spring Boot ReactJS
=> Kotlin Multi Platform
=> Machine Learning
=> C# and Unity (AR/VR and Game) => Windows Desktop C# (March/April)
=> Golang RESTful, GraphQL, Authentication, gRPC (April)
=> KMP for iOS|Android|Windows|Mac|Linux (May/June) [at this point U already knows all Native Platforms] => Basic Cloud Operations, Load Balancing, CI/CD
